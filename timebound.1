.Sh NAME
.Nm timebound
.Nd bound runtime of a monitored process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm timebound
.Op Fl d | \-debug
.Op Ar min Op Ar max
.Ar \-\-
.Ar cmd ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to bound the running time of a monitored process.
While the process runs,
.Nm
applies an optional maximum bound. When the process exits,
.Nm
applies the minimum bound. This allows the running time of
the program to be at least the minimum bound, and at most
the maximum bound.
.Pp
If the process fails some time after intialisation,
.Nm
will try to restart the process immediately, but applies exponential
backoff if the restarted process initialises but fails within
60 seconds. The backoff is capped at about 60 seconds, and is reset
if the process runs for longer than 60 seconds.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Fl \-debug
Print debugging information.
.El
.Sh ARGUMENTS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar min
Specify the minimum running time in seconds. The minimum bound
is only applied if the program exits, and is not applied if
a signal terminates the program. The default minimum is zero.
.It Ar max
Specify the maximum running time in seconds. If the maximum
bound is reached,
.Nm
will send the program a SIGTERM signal, and give the program 5s to
complete. After this time elapses,
.Nm
will send the program a SIGKILL signal.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
generally mirrors the exit status of the monitored process.
If the monitored process terminates due to a signal,
.Nm
will also terminate with the same signal. This allows the parent
to correctly interpret SIGINT, etc.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Ensure
.Xr ssh 1
runs for at least 3s, even if no network links are available:
.Pp
.Dl $ SSHOPTS='-o ConnectTimeout=10 -o ServerAliveInterval=10'
.Dl $ timebound 5 -- ssh $SSHOPTS phobos

.Sh NAME
.Nm respawn
.Nd monitor and restart processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm respawn
.Op Fl dfhZ
.Op Fl x | Fl \-exit Ar { none | exitcode,... }
.Op Fl \-continue
.Op Fl \-forever
.Ar \-\-
.Ar cmd ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to start a process and monitor it, restarting it as
necessary should it exit or terminate.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
will only restart the process if it has run for at least 1 second,
and did not terminate due to a signal, or exit successfully.
.Pp
When starting or restarting a process,
.Nm
requires that the process run for at least 1 second. If the process
fails to initialise, after 10 attempts,
.Nm
considers the process to have failed, and will exit making no
further attempt to start the process.
.Pp
If the process fails some time after intialisation,
.Nm
will try to restart the process immediately, but applies exponential
backoff if the restarted process initialises but fails within
60 seconds. The backoff is capped at about 60 seconds, and is reset
if the process runs for longer than 60 seconds.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
.It Fl f Fl \-forever
Repeatedly restart the process, without considering exit
codes or process termination. **respawn** will exit
if the process repeatedly fails to initialise.
.It Fl h
Print help summary.
.It Fl Z Fl \-continue
Send SIGCONT to the monitored process if it stops due to SIGSTOP or
SIGTSTP. This is useful for preventing unintentional suspension
with interactive programs like
.Xr ssh 1
which allows users to suspend the session with escape/control-Z.
.It Fl x Ar none , Fl \-exit Ar none
Reset the list of successful exit codes so that every exit status
is considered a failure.
.It Fl x Ar exitcode,... , Fl \-exit Ar exitcode,...
Augment the list of the succesful exit codes. The option takes
comma separated list of exit codes as an argument. The default list
contains exit code 0.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
generally mirrors the succesful exit status of the monitored process.
This will be 0 unless the
.Fl x
or
.Fl \-exit
options were used to add more success exit codes.
.Pp
Unless the
.Fl -f
or
.Fl \-forever
options are used, if the monitored process terminates due to a signal,
.Nm
will also terminate with the same signal. This allows the parent
to correctly interpret SIGINT, etc.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Restart an
.Xr ssh 1
session on connection failure:
.Pp
.Dl $ SSHOPTS='-o ConnectTimeout=10 -o ServerAliveInterval=10'
.Dl $ respawn -- ssh $SSHOPTS phobos
